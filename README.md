This project is a simple implementation of a Music
Player Management System using C++ programming, focusing on core
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The system enables users to manage a personal music playlist
persistently. Users can add new songs, view the full playlist, play a
selected song, and delete songs from the playlist. The implementation
emphasizes clarity, modularity, and user interaction, making it an
effective example of applying theoretical programming knowledge to
practical problem-solving.
